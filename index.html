            <h2>Pokémon</h2>
            <p>Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
                The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered around fictional creatures called "Pokémon". 
                In Pokémon, Pokémon Trainers are people who catch, train, care for, and battle with Pokémon. 
                The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), 
                a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. 
                Pokémon soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media. 
                Pokémon is one of the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The Pokémon video game series is the third best-selling video game franchise 
                of all time with more than 440 million copies sold and one billion mobile downloads. 
                The Pokémon video game series spawned an anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation of all time with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 192 countries.</p>

            <h2>The original who's that pokemon</h2>
            <p> If you have watched the anime you have most likely heard about it.
                It occurs before and after the main commercial break during the episode. 
                The silhouette of a Pokémon is shown, with someone usually asking the audience to guess the Pokémon that belongs to the given outline. 
                After the commercial break, the name of the Pokémon is revealed, usually with the current main characters shouting the name of the Pokémon.
                For a kid (or adult) you would feel like a Pokémon master if you answered the question right. 
                So this quiz is meant to test your Pokémon knowledge and see if you have it in you to be a Pokémon master!
